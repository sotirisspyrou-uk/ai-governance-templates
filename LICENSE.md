## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER - DEMONSTRATION CODE

**⚠️ THIS IS DEMONSTRATION CODE FOR PORTFOLIO PURPOSES ⚠️**

This repository contains demonstration code created to showcase technical capabilities in:
- Growth experimentation and A/B testing
- Advanced statistical analysis and modeling
- Data-driven optimization frameworks
- Statistical software architecture

### Usage Disclaimer

1. **Not Production Ready**: While functional, this code is designed for demonstration purposes and should NOT be used in production environments without proper testing, validation, and customization.

2. **Educational Use**: Feel free to use this code for learning, education, and as reference for your own implementations.

3. **No Warranty**: The code is provided "as is" for demonstration purposes. See full warranty disclaimer below.

4. **Professional Consulting**: For production implementations or consulting on growth experimentation, statistical analysis, or optimization projects, please contact the author.

### Statistical Methods Implemented

This framework demonstrates implementation of:
- Bayesian A/B testing with Beta-Binomial conjugate priors
- Sequential testing with early stopping boundaries
- Multi-armed bandit algorithms (Thompson Sampling, UCB, Epsilon-Greedy)
- Advanced confidence interval methods (Bootstrap, Bayesian, Exact)
- Effect size analysis (Cohen's d, Hedges' g, Common Language Effect Size)
- Multiple testing correction methods (Bonferroni, Holm, FDR control)
- Meta-analysis with heterogeneity assessment and publication bias detection
- Comprehensive power analysis and sample size optimization
