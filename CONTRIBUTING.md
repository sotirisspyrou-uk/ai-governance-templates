# Contributing to Growth Experiment Framework

## Overview

This is a **demonstration repository** showcasing advanced growth experimentation and statistical analysis capabilities. While the code is functional, it's primarily designed as a portfolio piece to demonstrate technical expertise in:

- A/B testing and experimentation
- Statistical analysis and modeling
- Growth optimization methodologies
- Data-driven decision making frameworks

## Demo Code Disclaimer

⚠️ **Important**: This is demonstration code created for portfolio purposes. While it implements sophisticated statistical methods and follows best practices, it should not be used in production environments without proper testing, validation, and customization for your specific use case.

## How to Contribute
