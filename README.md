## 🚀 Implementation Quick Start

### 1. Governance Assessment
```bash
# Run initial governance maturity assessment
python governance_assessment.py --organization="[Company]" --industry="[Sector]"

# Generate customized compliance roadmap  
python compliance_roadmap.py --regulations="eu-ai-act,iso42001,nist-rmf"

python board_report_generator.py --quarter="Q1-2025"
```

### 2. Risk Framework Setup
```python
from ai_governance import RiskAssessment, ComplianceChecker

# Initialize risk assessment
risk_assessor = RiskAssessment()
systems_inventory = risk_assessor.discover_ai_systems()

# Classify systems by risk level
for system in systems_inventory:
    risk_level = risk_assessor.classify_system(system)
    compliance_requirements = ComplianceChecker.get_requirements(
        system_type=system.type,
        risk_level=risk_level,
        jurisdiction="EU"
    )
    
    # Generate compliance checklist
    checklist = ComplianceChecker.generate_checklist(
        system=system,
        requirements=compliance_requirements
    )
```

### 3. Documentation Generation
```python
from ai_governance import DocumentationGenerator

# Generate system documentation
doc_generator = DocumentationGenerator()
